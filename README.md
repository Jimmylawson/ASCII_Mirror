# ASCII Mirror

## Description
<The ASCII Mirror project is a simple Java-based application that reads ASCII art from files and processes it to produce mirrored representations of the content. The program focuses on manipulating and formatting text to align with specific requirements, including identifying the longest line, formatting each line to match the longest, and creating reversed or mirrored versions of the ASCII art. The output is presented in a neatly formatted way for better readability and usability.>

## Features
<	•	File Reading: Reads ASCII art from user-specified files.
	•	Error Handling: Displays a “File not found” message for non-existent files.
	•	Line Formatting: Ensures all lines are formatted to the width of the longest line.
	•	Mirroring: Horizontally mirrors the ASCII art by reversing the text and replacing specific characters with their opposites (e.g., < to >, ( to ), etc.).
	•	Flexible Output: Outputs the original and reversed ASCII lines side by side for visual comparison.
	•	Customizable: Works with various ASCII art files, providing a versatile solution for text-based art manipulation.
>

## How It Works
<	1.	The program prompts the user to input a file path.
	2.	If the file exists, the ASCII art is read line by line and stored in a list.
	3.	Each line is formatted to match the length of the longest line.
	4.	The mirrored version of each line is generated by reversing the text and replacing characters.
	5.	Both the original and mirrored lines are printed side by side.

## Example Output
<Input the file path: 
> C:\ASCII_Animals\MooFolder\Cow.txt

    ^__^          |          ^__^
    (oo)\_______  |  _______/(oo)
    (__)\       )\/  \/       /(__)
        ||----w |      | w----||
        ||     ||      ||     ||
